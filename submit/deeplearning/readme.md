This is a basic UI application to recontruct Image.

To be able to run the application, you need a python environment (prefered Anaconda, python 3.6). You can download Anaconda and create an environment from this link: https://anaconda.org

Before running python code, You will need to install these packages into the python environment: numpy, Pillow, Sys, tkinter, skimage, torch, torchvision, random, math, scipy, keras.

Before running mathlab code, you need Mathlab_2021b version.

To be able to run prediction, you can run the notebook files to generate models and put them into machine_learning/ directory, or you can simply follow these links to download the models.

*** note: you will need to replace the old files in labels/ directory with new txt files if you use notebooks to generate new machine learning models.

To generate new machine learning model for prediction, you can run these notebooks and train the data
